            <h2>First Reference</h2>
            <p>If we look at our home/index page then a hint of familiarity
                might be noticed. That is because we used the home page of the site Amazon
                as a reference. While we did use it as a reference ours is much different, the most noticable
                is the minimalistic approach that we took on our website. That in itself is 
                the biggest difference to make our page vastly different.</p>

            <h2>Second Reference</h2>
            <p>A reference that was taken by one of our group-mates was in the blog page.
                While there might be some confusion on why such an easy to make page with all the instructions clear head to be
                referenced. That is because he was mixing Blog and Vlog up, thinking they were the same thing. But point in case
                as it can be see minimalism is still very much the theme here and while the muse used a page by page system
                in their blog page, we went with a scroll down method.

            <h2>Third Reference</h2>
            <p>The about us page of the website mysecondteacher was bright, long and on a single page. I believe that this is the page where 
                almost no resemblence can be made among the referenced and the referencee because while initially it gave us a great way to 
                start our about us page but then we realised the difference in sheer numbers alone. While MST has many people who can just write
                one line each but a book will still be filled but among us theres only 3 of us. So, we jsut appreciated it and took some bits 
                but ended up doing our own stuff.

            <h2>Fourth Reference</h2>
            <p>Being a Gen-Z kid we all have been impacted by the advancing society maybe much more than other. So, as a homage to a 
                tech company that we can say that it almost grew up with us, We referenced the Log-in/Sign-up page of Facebook. But of course
                not the model they have now rather a template way back when facebook was still new.

        <article class="research">
            <h2>Fifth Reference</h2>
            <p>For our last reference we referenced the check out list from Ali-Baba website. Although it might be a bit hard to see it
                and maybe some other site matches much more closer but the truth is that the guy who did it, he had already said from day 1
                that he's gonna make the checkout page while referencing Ali Baba. So,there's that.
