                <p>3D printers are the latest technology printing machines.
                    While the two industries are not in direct competition with each other, 
                    3D printing creates opportunities for printing industry hopefuls to capture a new market corner 
                    and expand their product offering. While these two are somewhat distant from each other
                    function wise, they will probably integrate together in the future.</p>

                <p>Consider how often you and your staff use your office printer?
                    It’s easy to take your printer for granted when it’s working perfectly.
                    However, if it’s “misbehaving” and frustrating you with paper jams, blurred copies, and other issues, 
                    that’s when you realize how much you rely on it day in and day out. 
                    Fortunately, regular printer maintenance will help ensure your printer delivers peak performance when you need 
                    it most—which is likely all the time.
                    The main factors that affect your printer the most are Environment, Level of use and Paper Quality.
                    Master how to mitigate these factors to make your printer your money worth.</p>

            <h2>The Future of Printers</h2>
            <p>As technology continues to advance, what does the future hold for printers?</p>

            <div id="expandedContent3" style="display: none;">
                <p>"Digital printing" which is basically the kind of printing that you do 
                    i.e. preparing images, templates, and documents digitally before sending them directly to the printer. 
                    The future of printing technology lies in digital printing because, according to tentative estimates, 
                    it grew by another 30 percent in the last year.
                    The growth of digital printing is evident also from the fact that colour printing has seen a rise 
                    in the last few years with inkjet printing growing leaps and bounds. By 2021, 
                    estimates say that the number of colour pages have already touched 1.2 trillion pages globally!</p>

            <h2>Impact Upon Environment</h2>
            <p>Never thought about it? A myth or a hoax? How?.....</p>

                    According to one source, Americans alone use 85,000,000 tons of paper every year. 
                    That’s seven trees a year per American. Much of that paper is used in schools or office environments. 
                    That is a lot of trees that have to be cut down to supply that amount of paper. And what happens to the majority 
                    of that paper? Landfills!
                    In the modern, digital age, you would think that paper use has gone down, 
                    but studies have found that over the last 20 years, paper consumption has actually gone up 126%. 
                    The average office worker uses 10,000 sheets of paper annually.
                    It’s estimated that over 1 billion ink cartridges are sold each year worldwide. 
                    The greenhouse gas emissions it takes to manufacture a supply of ink cartridges this size is astounding. 
                    The chemicals in printer ink can be extremely harmful to the environment in addition to the petroleum oil 
                    and non-biodegradable plastic casing found in some ink and toner cartridges.
                    When you simply throw your ink cartridges in the trash, they end up in a landfill or worse, the ocean. 
                    The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and heavy metals in printer ink can lead to soil and even water pollution 
                    when left in landfills. And as many of us know, plastic can take thousands of years to degrade and even then, 
                    they will continue to pollute the soil.

                <p>The progress of technology is inevitable unless humans discover or create something more magical than 
                    being able to transfer data through a kind of wobbly-air(signals). Even though for the advancement of technology 
                    humans make a lot of waste and destruction but as soon as it come to bite them in the ass then they'll rush
                    to make a remedy and will most likely succeed in it unless they don't. But either way its a long time for that day
                    to come. You won't live that long. So, enjoy the present the future will be taken care by future generation. Do what you want! You can do it! 
                    Believe it! .</p>
